# How do I approach designing software?
    ## In this project helped me learn how to reneder objects to screen, view them and manipulating them using the OpenGL library.
# How do I approach developing programs?
    ## This project helped me to understanding the planning phase for developing 3D graphics, for example generating the vertex array objects required to render meshes to screen.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    ## Since I hope to practice computer graphics programming in my software engineering career this project helped bridge the gap between graphic design and graphic programming.
